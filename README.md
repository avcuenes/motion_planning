# motion_planning

This project have written for the motion planning for car-like vehicles.

## Project Description

At this project, we use the following algorithm for motion planning. Kinodynamics RRT* motion planning algorithm implemented.And also, we design the software to implement the other motion planning algorithms.

## Projects 
There is a few projects to simulate real life. Projects ros-graph is like the following pictures;

![](rosgraph.svg)

### home_point_pub
This project just publishes home point location information.

### map_constraint_pub
This project just publishes map constraint information.

### obstacle_location
This project just publishes obstacle location information.

### rrt_star
This project calculate path with respect to the given information from home point, target point, map constraint and obstacle location topics.

### target_point_pub
This project publishes target point location information

### visualization
This project visualize the start and end point, paths generated from rrt_star project and obstacle location.

## Kinodynamic RRT* 

You can find more information about kinodynamic RRT* in the [kinodyamic RRT* docs](/docs/kinodynamicrrtstar.md) and [differential drive mode docs](/docs/differentialdrivemodel.md).

## How to Run the Project

We test this project using the following ros2 foxy distro and ubuntu 20.04.

Please be sure, you are in the right directory. Tou sure about this write the following to terminal;

```bash
ls
```

You can see the following folders at terminal;

```bash
docs  Makefile  MotionPlanning.drawio.pdf  README.md  rosgraph.svg  src
```
At this project , we use some python scripts to visualize the plot because of that you be sure to use the right version of python library.
We use python3 for this project , please write the following command to sure python version is 3;
```bash
python3 --version
```
And check the python library. If you see the following output , you can sure;

```bash
Python 3.8.10
```

To setup the other python libraries , write the following command;

```bash
cd tools/setup
bash setup.sh
```

Then,Please open the new terminal and write the following command to build the project;

```bash
make build_all
```
or 
```bash
colcon build 
```

After the build is complete. You can run the following command;

```bash
make source_project
```
> [!NOTE]  
> For every new terminal you have to source project.


Then every project can run new terminal. You can run the following command to run projects.

```bash
make run_home_point
make run_target_point
make run_rrt_start
make run_obstacle_point
make run_map
make run_viz
```
or 

```bash
ros2 run home_point_pub homepoint
ros2 run target_point_pub targetpoint
ros2 run rrt_star rrtstar
ros2 run obstacle_location obstaclelocation
ros2 run map_const map 
ros2 run visulization viz 
```
